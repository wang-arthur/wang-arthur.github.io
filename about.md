I recently completed a PhD in English at Yale University. Beginning in Fall 2022, I will be a Provost's Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication.<!--My current work considers how the frustrated ambitions of scientific research programs produce common knowledge and social facts, and examines the feminist and multiethnic science fictions (broadly conceived) that adapt and appropriate these "minor universals." I am also developing a new project on scientific biography, and its role in literary history and in scientific cultures.-->

My research has appeared in _Contemporary Literature_ and _American Literature_ and I am the managing editor of [_Post45_](https://post45.org). Before graduate school, I worked as a software engineer at Datadog (<img class="icon" src="../images/dd_icon_rgb.svg" />).
