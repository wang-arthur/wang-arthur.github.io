<!--Samantha Pergadia, Aku Ammah-Tagoe, and Arthur Z. Wang at ASAP/9 in New Orleans-->

I am completing a PhD in English at Yale University. <!--My current work considers how the frustrated ambitions of scientific research programs produce common knowledge and social facts, and examines the feminist and multiethnic science fictions (broadly conceived) that adapt and appropriate these "minor universals." I am also developing a new project on scientific biography, and its role in literary history and in scientific cultures.-->

My research has appeared in _Contemporary Literature_ and I am managing editor of [_Post45_](https://post45.org). Before graduate school, I worked as a software engineer at Datadog.
